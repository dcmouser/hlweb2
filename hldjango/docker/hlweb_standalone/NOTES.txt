This is the docker I upload for people to use locally.

This is the docker you can use to build cases on a local pc.
It's also a way I can test a full build before trying on the real web server.
It does NOT use my windows local files.

I THINK After you build and run, open browser at:
http://localhost/games
OR is it http://localhost:8000/
But you may have to go through docker desktop app to get url.

Default initial superuser is: admin / admin

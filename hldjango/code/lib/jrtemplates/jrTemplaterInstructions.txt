Template files are broken into sections, preceded by a special header.

% TEMPLATE DIRECTIVE: ANY TEXT HERE

% TEMPLATE IGNORE
...
This will be ignored when used by the template system, but can put stuff here that we want to run when running the standalone latex

% TEMPLATE PREAMBLE
...
This text will be added to the final output latex ONCE no matter how many uses

% TEMPLATE USE
...
This text is inserted every time the template is used, and {{VARNAME}} is replaced by the template variable.

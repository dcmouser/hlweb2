Every detective has their own system of keeping notes, but this case is a particularly long and difficult one, which you will not complete in one session. To be successful, you will need to keep good notes and take your time. Here are some suggestions:
. Keep track of persons of interest and their roles.
. Keep track of places you have visited and when you need to return to them.
. Keep track of things you need to remember to resolve.
. Take frequent breaks to discuss theories.

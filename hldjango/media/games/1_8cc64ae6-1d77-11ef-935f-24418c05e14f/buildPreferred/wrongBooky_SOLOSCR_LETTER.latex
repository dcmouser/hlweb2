\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{~~Instructions}
\label{sec:Instructions}
To play this case you will need:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
A blank case log sheet, and a few blank Lead Note sheets, to track your progress

\item 
White, Yellow, and Reverse Directories

\item 
Map Atlas w/ interleaved Neighborhood Guide

\item 
Rulebook, Research Guide, and Navigation Guide

\end{itemize}

~

\textbf{IMPORTANT NOTE}

The markers [A,B,C,..] are completely different from the markers [A2, B2, C2,...]

~

\textbf{Tracking Time}

As each day begins, you will be told what time the day starts and what time the day ends.  Record this information on your Case Log sheet (bottom right).  Start a new Lead Notes sheet for each day, and record every lead that you visit, along with the (starting) time of each visit.

When you read a lead in the story book, you will be told the duration of that lead.  Add this duration to the current time and write this new time on the next blank line; this will be the starting time for the next lead you visit.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Note: Looking up a lead that is not found in the story book does not cause time to pass.

\end{itemize}

~

\textbf{Ending your Day}

When each day begins, you will be given a list of items (typically Markers) that \textbf{must} be found before you can move on to the next day.  If you find all of these items \textit{before} the designated day end time, you may keep playing until you reach the end time for the current day. Then move on to the day's end-of-shift briefing.

~

\textbf{Overtime}

If the current time passes beyond the designated end time for the day, but you have \textbf{not} found all of the day's items, then the next lead you visit will trigger \textit{Overtime}. When this happens, mark the checkbox on your Case Log that indicates that you have entered overtime (OT) for the current day, and mark \textbf{5} demerit checkboxes.

Now, for the remainder of the day, you will no longer record the time of lead visits. The clock no longer advances, and you ignore all storybook instructions to do so for the remainder of the day. Note:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
If you encounter lead text that asks what the current time is while you are in overtime, you should consider the current time to be the day's end time.

\item 
If you are in overtime and find all of the required items, your day ends.

\end{itemize}

~

\textbf{Flextime Mode}

Flextime mode is an optional way to play for those who dislike having to micro-manage the passage of time.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
Ignore all time tracking instructions during the game. Do not record lead times or track the current time. Take as long as you want on each day. You are never in overtime.

\item 
Should you encounter text asking you what time of day it is, simply pick a time of your choice which is: 1) Within the start and end time for day, and 2) Later than any previously chosen time on the same day.

\item 
You may not move on from the current day before you find all of the day's required items; after you find them you may continue the day for as long as you like.

\end{itemize}

Playing in Flextime mode may reduce the tension you experience but will not otherwise reduce the richness of your experience, and may be more enjoyable for people who would rather focus on the narrative experience without being distracted by record keeping.

~

\textbf{Wrapping-up}

Note that after the last day of your case ends, you will proceed to a conclusion section, but you will have a final opportunity to resume searching for leads without any time limit.

\textbf{11 am Monday, March 1st, 1948}

I got into the office early this morning and opened the place up myself.  These days it’s almost easier to sleep in my chair than in my bed.  I’m just dozing off when I hear a knock at the door.

There’s just enough of a pause to give me time to push my hat back and pretend I’m awake.  In walks Jewel with a stack of papers in her hand, trailed by a lady I don’t recognize.  She looks to be in her early 40s.  She’s well put together, with matching black hat and handbag, and shiny black heels.  Looks like she’s from money -- my favorite kind of client.

"This is Mrs. Browning," says Jewel. "She wants to hire you to find something or other."

I stand up and stick out my hand. "Nice to meet you, Mrs. Browning," I say, and she puts her white-gloved hand in mine.

"I’ll take it from here," I say to Jewel, who’s already headed for the door.

"If she’s looking for a bird, don’t take the job," she says over her shoulder.

"You’re not, are you?" I say to Mrs. Browning.

"Not what?" she asks.

"Looking for a lost bird."

"Who are you, Sam Spade?"

A big grin forms on my face, and I sit back down in my chair.  She may be from money, but I like her already.  "No", she says, "I’m looking for a book".

She sits down in the chair opposite my desk and digs into her handbag for a cigarette.  I know how this goes, so I just wait for her to get settled and start talking.

"It’s a very rare and valuable book, Mr. Deverell.  One that’s been in my family for generations.  It’s been stolen, and I want you to get it back for me."

"Sounds like a job for the police," I say.

She rolls her eyes and leans forward to tap her cigarette in my ashtray.  "I just came from the police -- they’re the ones who sent me to you."

"I see."  I loosen my tie and pull out the ledger from my desk drawer.  "Well, my rate is 50 dollars a day plus expenses -- and that’s whether I recover the book or not."  What I don’t say is that my normal rate’s 40 dollars a day; the extra 10 is my matching-hat-and-handbag rate.  "If that suits you, we can get started right away."

"That will be just fine," she says.

"OK, start from the beginning, tell me about this book and what you think happened to it."

"Very well," she says, rummaging into her handbag.  "This is a photo of the book."  She hands me a photo of an ornate book, indicating that I can keep it.

"It’s an Octavo King James Bible. It was purchased by my great-great-great-grandfather in 1700."  She hesitates for a moment, like she’s choosing her words carefully.  "You must understand, Mr. Deverell, that I come from a deeply religious family -- this book has been smuggled across oceans and deserts, and passed down from generation to generation, from mother to daughter to daughter.  And now it’s been stolen. I must have it back.  It is of incalculable sentimental value."

"I guess it’s got some non-sentimental value, as well."

She wrinkles her mouth.  "It is worth a small fortune.  Though that is of little concern to me."

She takes a long drag of her cigarette and continues.

"I came down from Boston the day before yesterday, to have it appraised -- for insurance purposes, you understand.  I had appointments yesterday with two dealers that had come highly recommended.  The first, a fellow named Wyckoff.  An older gentleman, perhaps 60 years old, tall, white hair, and walks with a limp.  He arrived at my hotel room around 8am.  He studied the book for about 30 minutes, then asked to take the book home with him overnight so he could study it further.  I told him that was out of the question.

The second dealer was a Mr. Gorski, who came by around 10am. He was a tiny man, Polish maybe, in his 40s or 50s, with a round balding head and wire-rimmed glasses. He spent a good hour going over the book with a magnifying glass, and said he would get back to me with his assessment.  He also requested that he be permitted to take the book back to his apartment to study it.  I again said no.  That was yesterday.  This morning I went out for breakfast -- I couldn’t have been gone for more than an hour -- and when I returned to the room, the book was gone."

"So it was taken from your hotel room this morning.  You’re quite sure of that?"

"Quite."

"And you’ve no doubt talked to the hotel staff already?  Could a maid have walked off with it?"

She taps her cigarette into the ashtray.  "I’ve talked to the hotel staff.  They claim that the maid was nowhere near the room while I was out."

"Nothing else disturbed?" I ask.  "Nothing else taken?"

"Some jewelry in a nightstand drawer was also taken -- ruby earrings and a matching ruby and silver necklace and bracelet, but they are of no importance to me.  There was cash and traveler’s checks on the entryway table that were untouched."

"And where is it you’re staying?" I ask.

"The Hotel Cumberland in Times Square.  Room 713."

"I guess that rules out someone coming in through the window.  Any sign of someone messing with the lock to your door?"

"I’m sure I have no idea."

"OK, Mrs. Browning, I think that gives me enough to get started."  I stand up and show her to the door.  "I can reach you at the Cumberland?"

"Yes, you can call directly up to room 713 by dialing \#\hyperref[sec:7{-}9422]{7{-}9422}."

Then, with the first sign of real concern I’ve seen from her, she says "Until the book is recovered I dare not return home.  Oh, if you do find the book, Mr. Deverell, please be very careful with it -- it’s several hundred years old and in very fragile shape -- the less you handle it the better."

I get into my office a little past 9am on Tuesday morning, and I find Jewel glaring at a large brown-paper-wrapped parcel sitting in the center of her desk, about the size of a typewriter.

"What’s that?" I ask.

"Somebody dropped it off in front of the door a few minutes after I got in and skedaddled.  Doesn’t have a return address."

We both stare at it for a long minute.  "I don’t suppose you have a secret admirer?" I ask.

"Maybe your new girlfriend got you a hat to match your shoes."

We spend another minute staring at the writing on the package.  It’s ornate, a bit like calligraphy.  All it says is "Detective’s Office".

Finally I take the pocket knife out of my back pocket with a flourish and snap it open, then cut off the outer wrapping.

"You were right," I say. "It’s a hat box."

There’s a faded watermark on the bottom, "Classic" something or another -- I can’t quite make it out.  I slit open the packing tape, and underneath several layers of newspaper I find a heavy book, wrapped in what appears to be several layers of silk.

There’s a note on top, in the same calligraphy. Jewel and I read it together.

"Looks like your case just solved itself," says Jewel.

"Ring up Mrs. Browning at the Cumberland," I say.  "Tell her I’m on my way over.  And Jewel -- don’t tell her what I’m bringing."

She rolls her eyes at me.  "Promises, promises."

Before I can say something stupid, a small white van pulls up with the word "SPEEDY" written on the side, and a young man in overalls hops out, bounds up the steps, and lays an envelope in front of our door.  "Mmm… the coffee smells good," he says, and winks at Jewel. "I could do with a cup myself."  And then he’s off.

I roll my eyes. "Good grief."

The writing on the envelope seems to match the hat box note from yesterday.  Again, no return address.

"You know," says Jewel, "Mrs. Browning has called twice this morning asking if we’ve made any progress finding her book.  Want me to ring her up and let her know about this note?"

"Hmmm… I don’t know…  Maybe Mrs. Browning should sit this one out."

I take in the scene around the apartment building.  Sure enough, I can see the East River only a couple dozen feet away -- a rare case of truth in advertising.  Of course, why you’d want to live near the East River is another question.

Not much traffic around here and it’s all pretty exposed, except that across the street to the south I see a large dark alcove that looks like it’s a side entrance to the church.  Might make a good place for a stakeout.

The Phoenix Safe Company shop is hard to miss: Painted on the large glass window is a figure of a strange looking bird, with white feathered wings outstretched and surrounded by bright orange flames. The name of the shop in large orange letters above it.  But inside it’s small -- just a showroom and a door that’s ajar to a small back room.   On the wall of the showroom there’s a big ornate wooden crucifix.  Through the doorway to the back room I can see a smaller one mounted on the office wall, as well as a large black floor safe.  But I can’t see all the way inside to tell if there’s anyone in there.  In the showroom, at the front desk, is a well-dressed old man with thinning white hair and a big smile.  He seems genuinely excited to chat about locks and safes.

I introduce myself and look around the showroom a bit, thinking about whether we could use a safe for the office.

"Let me ask you something," I say.  "How hard would it be to get into a hotel room door? How long would it take?"

"I suppose it depends," he says, "on whether it’s the Waldorf Astoria or some rinky-dink hotel, and on whether you wanted it done properly or it was a rush job."

"Could I hire you to open a hotel room door for me?" I ask.

There’s a long pause and he seems to be sizing me up, then he takes a step backward and says "Well, only if you’re the hotel manager."  Behind him I see a younger gentleman peer out of the back room doorway, brushing back his long brown hair.

"Everything OK out there, Pop?"

"You sure you’re a P.I.?" the old man asks.

"Well, that’s what it says in the phone book."

"A comedian too, huh?" and he gives a big grin.

We both chuckle, and I head out.

I get to the front desk of the Cumberland hoping to find the guy who was working early morning yesterday.

"I’m looking for someone who was on duty early yesterday morning, would that be you?"

"Yes sir."

"Could you tell me if Mrs. Browning left her room yesterday morning?"

"Yes, she came down from her room around 7:30 am, dressed in all black, and asked where she could get a sandwich.  I told her that the hotel restaurant might be able to make her one at 8am, but she seemed in a hurry so I suggested a deli on 7th Avenue,"  I’m not sure where she went, but she was back by 8am or 8:30am."

"And she was alone when she left? And when she came back as well?"

"I believe so.  I don’t remember seeing anyone with her."

"And no one came by asking for her while she was out?"

"I don’t believe so."

"Well you were the only one on duty, right? You would know if someone came by looking for her, yeah?"

"Yes, sir - Until 9am I was the only one on duty and couldn’t leave my station unattended; so if anyone came by before then, I would have known about it."

"Very good.  Can you tell me if Mrs. Browning is in her room now?" I ask.

"I believe she is, sir."

"And has she had any visitors today?"

"She has not."

"And no one has called for her?"

"No, sir."

I thank him for his help, and am just turning to leave when a thought seems to occur to him.

"Umm…  Actually, you know, now that I think about it…  There was something a little unusual that happened just before 8.  A man in overalls came in and walked right past me to the elevators.  I normally would have stopped him, because he didn’t look like a guest, and it seemed a little early for maintenance work, but he seemed to know where he was going so I didn’t think much of it."

"Could he have been going to Mrs. Browning’s room?"

"Well, I don’t think so.  He’d be going the long way around if he was."

"Can you remember what this fellow looked like?"

"Let’s see…  Blue overalls and work boots.  Brown hair, slicked back. Maybe in his 20s?  He may have had glasses…  I’m sorry, I can’t remember."

I pass him my card.  "If you think of anything else, give me a ring."

"Thanks for talking to me Maria. I’m sorry to bother you at your home, it’s just that I’m in a bit of a hurry. Can you tell me anything about the fare you picked up on Tuesday night, around midnight, near the park?"

She remembers the late night fare from Tuesday.  Big giant man with hairy hands and a bushy beard, with a thick black head of unruly hair.

"At least 6 and a half feet tall, I’d say."

"A big boy, huh?  Was he talkative?"

"No, just told me he wanted to be dropped off at the Cumberland Hotel.  He had an accent, Indian I think?  Does that help?"

"Hmm…  I’m not sure," I say.  "Anything else?"

"Well, he told me his name."

"He told you his name?" I repeat, shocked.

"Well, I introduce myself to everyone who gets into my cab.  I say ‘Greetings, friend, my name is Maria Ateaga, and I’ll be your driver today, and what’s your name?’"  And nine times out of ten they’ll tell me their life story, or ask to hear mine."

"And this guy?"

"Well, he just said his name and then clammed up.  Let me think what did he say his name was… Choku or Chako, something like that.  Not American, that’s for sure."

"Thanks, that’s helpful.  Anything else you remember?"

"Not really," she says.  "Except that he smelled something awful.  I couldn’t quite place it…  like cloves and rose petals mixed together."

I pull out a cloth handkerchief and take off my tie, and try to tie it around the wound in the attendant’s throat.  He’s in kind of a panic, and fights against me moving his hands, but eventually we get it on and his hands have something to press against.  It’s a pretty deep cut and he’s lost a lot of blood already.  I’m not sure he’s going to make it.

"Can you stand up?" I ask him.  But he’s in shock and he’s not walking anywhere on his own two feet.

I call out towards the steps -- "Help!  I need some help down here!"  Then I put my arms around the guy's torso and lift him up.  The motion jolts a fresh stream of blood out of his neck.

I carry him up the steep steps as quickly as I can, which is to say not quickly at all, blood dripping the whole way.  When we get to the top, I walk him over to the curb and lay him down against the light pole.  There’s a crowd forming now, people gasping and holding their hands to their mouths, but no one actually doing anything to help.

I step into the street and hail a cab on Lexington -- thankfully the street is filled with them.  I lift the man into the cab, push him to the end of the seat and hand the cabbie a five dollar bill and tell him to take the guy to a hospital.  He heads off south and I watch him go, still in shock.  I probably should have gone with them, but I’m not thinking clearly.

Standing there staring down Lexington I try to calm my breathing and regain my wits.  What just happened?  I don’t think I was spotted by my guy, but even if I was, why would he have attacked this attendant?  Was this just a coincidence?

"I couldn’t care less how happy you are, Mr. Deverell.  Now where is my book?"

I rip off a sheet of paper from the notepad on my desk and jot down the address of the Phoenix Safe Company, then slide it over to her.  "I’m pretty sure you’ll find it in the floor safe in the back office."

"You’re \textit{pretty sure} I’ll find it there, are you?"

"Yeah, pretty sure."

"Well, go get it then, Mr. Deverell -- that’s what I’m paying you for."

"No, Mrs. Browning, you’ve paid me to find the book, and I’ve found it.  And now I’m done with this whole mess.  You can settle up with Jewel out front."

Mrs. Browning folds the note in half, and stares at me with a blank expression.  Jewel breaks the silence.

"Mrs. Browning, if you’ll come with me I’ll get you a list of outstanding expenses.  Will you be paying the remainder of your bill by check or cash?"

Mrs. Browning gives Jewel a disgusted look, then slowly opens her purse and puts the note inside, snapping it shut.  "You’ll have to sue me for the remainder of that bill," she says to me.  Then she smooths down her jacket and brushes past Jewel without another word.

"That fucking bitch," I say under my breath.

"Jack! Language!" barks Jewel.

"Meh… That fucking \textit{dame}...".

\label{sec:1{-}9825}\textbf{Goud, R. - Apt. 3d}%


The door to Apt. 3d is opened by an elderly woman with curlers in her hair.  A shirtless man in his boxers stands behind her, his thinning hair a tangled mess.

"Oh, come in, come in, dearie," she says, "it’s in the bathroom."

"What’s in the bathroom?" I say, taking off my hat, and smoothing down my hair.

"The toilet," she says.

"Oh, that’s OK, I’ve seen one before."

The old man behind her scrunches up his face and gives a little "feh" gesture with his hand.

"Actually, ma’am, I’m hoping you can tell me something about your neighbor in 3c -- a Mr. Gorski."

"Eh, no one lives there," grunts the old man from the back, waving his arm in a gesture he seems to be awfully fond of.

The old woman in curlers leans in to talk to me, her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone.  "There’s something very strange about that apartment, dearie.  Someone comes by every Tuesday morning to get the mail, like clockwork."

"Oh? What do they look like?" I ask.

"Well… I haven’t seen them myself. I like to stay inside.  But I hear them," she taps her finger to her ear, "through the door, you see.  Every Tuesday, like clockwork. They unlock the door, they go in, they collect the mail, and then they leave. Only takes them a minute – just like clockwork."

"Thank you very much, dearie." I say.

I settle into the darkened alcove of the 51st St. Church, with a good view of the River House Apartments.  I’ve got a supply of coffee and cigarettes, but I’m hoping this won’t be an all day affair.  The only problem with the place I’ve chosen is I’m getting occasional nasty looks from passers-by.  One big guy across the street looks like he’s fixing to come over and heave me out of my hidey-hole, but then thinks better of it when he sees I’m settled in with my coffee and won’t be easy to dislodge.  I guess it’s true that they don’t take kindly to loitering in Turtle Bay.

Meanwhile I’m looking for someone that matches Gorski’s description -- short, balding, with wire-rim glasses.  Then I just have to figure out what to do if he shows up to pick up his mail.

An hour in, I see someone head to the entrance who looks out of place.  It’s definitely not Gorski.  He’s wearing a tan suit and hat.  Clean shaven.  Tall and skinny, with a pencil moustache.  There’s something odd about the way he’s carrying himself, though -- he’s not walking like he’s heading home, he’s walking like he’s just making a quick stop.

A couple of minutes after coming in the front door, he’s out again, stuffing envelopes into his jacket pocket.  Bingo.  I don’t know who this guy is, but there can’t be much doubt he’s just gone and collected Gorski’s mail for the week.  I decide to tail him.

He heads back down 52nd Street, the way he came.  He’s on the north side of the street, and I’m across the street on the south side, maybe 500 hundred feet behind him -- half a block away.  Not many people on the street this far east, but if he keeps going west I’m going to have to close some ground if I don’t want to lose him.

Sure enough he keeps heading west, across 2nd Avenue, and then right past the 17th Precinct, where he doesn’t skip a beat.  I’m trying to pick up my pace but he’s still a couple hundred feet in front of me, and when he gets to Lexington he crosses the street against the light, then turns left, and I lose sight of him.

I jog to the corner as inconspicuously as I can in a suit and hat, and look to the left, but I don’t see him.  He can’t have gone far -- but where did he go?

The Convent of the Sacred Heart is a beautiful old building, originally built in 1914 as the residence of Otto H. Kahn, a German financier.  It’s currently a Roman Catholic girls’ school.  At least that’s the idea, though it seems like it’s been closed for repairs or reorganization for the last year or so.

I notice that while the main front entrance looks like it hasn’t been used in a while, there’s a side entrance that looks like it gets regular use.  The side door is surrounded by large white granite blocks, and looks to be made of steel, with no less than 3 locks on the door.  I know the church is concerned about chastity, but this seems a little excessive.  There’s a small metal plate near the top lock with the initials "PSC" stamped on it.

I listen quietly for any sounds behind the door, but don’t hear anything.  I knock lightly. No answer.  I reach for the doorknob and that’s when I see it: a small smear of blood.  Then I spot another near the edge of the door, and a few more drops on the ground outside.

"Certainly, sir," says the man at the reservation desk.  But there’s no answer.

"Hey, it’s you again," says the guy at the Citywide Parcels counter.  "You know, you could save me a drive if you want to come pick up your own packages."

"You dropped off a letter this morning.  Same sender as yesterday?  Short guy, balding, wire-rim glasses?"

"That’s the one.  He seemed pretty rattled this morning -- was waiting for me when I opened up, checking over his shoulder the whole time."

"And he didn’t send any other packages or letters to anyone else?"

"Well, I couldn’t tell you if he did.  But no, he didn’t."

It takes me a minute to process that before I say goodbye and head out.  I make a mental note to myself that if I come back here again, I’m going to have to bring this guy a box of chocolates.

\label{sec:3{-}4281}\textbf{Room 713 of the Cumberland Hotel}%


I take the elevator to the 7th floor of the Cumberland, and remove my hat before knocking on the door of 713.

Mrs. Browning opens the door, wearing heels and a black dress. She seems perhaps a little surprised to see me.

"I didn’t expect to see you so soon," she says, turning her back to me and retreating into the room.  I follow her in.  "Have you found it already?"

"No, no.  I just thought I should come and take a look at the scene of the crime, as it were.  May I?"  I gesture to the room.

"Of course."

I start by taking a look at the door and its lock.  Standard hotel fare -- nothing fancy, and it certainly hasn’t been forced.  The lock does look a little scraped up and it seems like there might be a little bit of oil around the lock face, but it’s hard to know how old that might be or if it means anything.  There’s certainly no obvious signs of breaking and entering.

I begin to walk aimlessly around the room, taking it all in, hat in hand.  Mrs. Browning leans against the room bar, a drink in her hand.  She doesn’t offer me one.

"It’s just you then? You came into the city alone, yesterday?"

"The day before yesterday."

"And you weren’t concerned about traveling alone with such an expensive item? You weren’t worried that you might be robbed?"

"I’ve never had any trouble before.  I prefer to travel inconspicuously."

She doesn’t really seem like the inconspicuous type to me, but I don’t press the issue.

"And when they came to look at the book…  It was here in the main room?"

"No, it was in the bedroom," she says, pointing.  I head in.

There’s a slightly strange smell in the room -- something like smoke, but a little more exotic.  It tickles my throat a bit.  I can’t quite place it.

I look out the windows.  It’s a long way down, and no ledge.

"You said the book was taken while you were across the street for breakfast, yeah?"

"Yes."

"And where did you leave the book when you left the room?"

"It was in my suitcase, in the closet."  She indicates the bedroom closet.  "Under a hat box, and other things."

"And the men who came to look at it, did they see where you kept it?"

"No."

"And you said they also took some jewelry?"

"Yes, a set of ruby earrings and a matching ruby necklace and bracelet. From the nightstand, here."  She points.

"They were sitting on top of the nightstand, or in the drawer?"

She thinks for a moment.  "Inside the drawer."

"You’re \textit{sure?}"

"I am sure."

"Is it possible that the jewelry was taken earlier, while the book was being examined? Did you  leave either of the men alone in the room for any period of time?"

She thinks for a moment.  "I don’t think so...  I suppose I might have left them alone in the room briefly while I went to make a drink or to have a cigarette."

"And the two men you told me about, those are the only men who’ve been up in your room since you’ve been in the hotel?"

She narrows her eyes at me before answering. "Yes."

"Is there anyone else you can think of who knows you’ve come to New York to have the book appraised, and knows where you’re staying?"

"No. Certainly not."

"Hmm…"  I pace around the room for a few more quiet minutes, thinking and tapping my hat against my hand.

"Can I offer you a drink, Mr. Deverell?"

"No, no, I should be going.  I’ll stop by tomorrow and give you an update."

"Very well.  Would you be so kind as to ring up beforehand -- I don’t mean to seem rude, but a lady sometimes needs time to get her face on."

"Of course," I say apologetically, noticing a harshness in her eyes that I hadn’t seen earlier.  "I’ll be in touch."

I head out to the elevator, troubled by the strange lingering smell from the bedroom, which seems to be following me down the corridor.

\label{sec:3{-}4452}\textbf{Cremonesi's Pawnbroker}%


The bell rings over the door of Cremonesi’s pawn shop on Allen Street.  It’s a dark, dusty, cramped one-room store.  There’s a man standing behind a counter at the far end of the room, facing me.  An old guy, maybe 70 years old, with a thick head of white hair combed down in a bowl cut.  There’s also  a younger guy sitting down next to him staring at the floor.  Late 20s maybe, short brown hair cut in a similar style.  Maybe these guys are cutting each other’s hair.  There must be a back door too, since I hear it closing behind someone leaving.

I take my time working my way to the back, looking through the worthless junk and occasional military souvenir.  The old man is standing over a cabinet of jewelry.  I take a quick scan -- nothing made of rubies, but a few odd items like a silver necklace with what looks like a razor blade in the center, and a gold bracelet with a pentagram charm.

"I’m looking for a ruby bracelet that someone may have brought in recently."

"I don’t know nothing about it." says the old man.

"I’d like to see your records," I say.

"Get lost, you -- I don’t got to show you nothin.  I’m a taxpayer.  I ain’t done nothin wrong."

"It may be stolen," I tell him, "You don’t want to be selling stolen merchandise, do you?"

"God damn you vermin!  Always harassing me!  Always trying to lock up Cremonesi!  50 years trying to lock me up!  I tell you I ain’t seen them.  Now get out of my store, you scoundrel, before I wallop you over the head and sell your fillings!"  And with that, he reaches behind him and grabs a broom from some dark shadow.

"OK, OK," I say.  "Take it easy."  I’m actually kind of surprised the old man knows what a broom looks like.  Deciding I’ve heard enough, I back out the way I came in.

\label{sec:3{-}6260}\textbf{Carnegie District Precinct (\#\hyperref[sec:7{-}7572]{7{-}7572} on p.\pageref*{sec:7{-}7572}) contd.}%


The Carnegie precinct looks like a cushy detail for cops wanting to enjoy the second half of their careers.  Back when I was a cop, I wouldn’t be caught dead working in such a sleepy neighborhood.  The decor looks like they aren’t hurting for money either.

I look around on the off-chance that I recognize someone, but no such luck, so I tell the officer on duty that I’m a PI and may have some information about yesterday’s murder at the Engineer’s Gate in Central Park.  He directs me to the detectives’ room up the wide polished marble staircase.

The detective in charge of the case has his own office, and not a small one.  He’s eating a sandwich with a knife and a fork.  He sees me staring at his plate.

"My dentures are acting up," he says, pointing to his mouth with his fork, as if that explained it. "What do you know about my murder?"

"Was he a tall guy, tan suit, pencil-thin moustache?"

"Yeah, what do you know about him?"

I decide that he doesn’t need to know about Mrs. Browning and her book, and just tell him that I think it’s likely he was killed by the same guy who cut the throat of the subway attendant at 51st Street.

"Did you identify the body?" I ask.

Dentures pauses with the fork half-way in his mouth and peers up at me.  This guy’s going to make me work for it.

"Was it by any chance a Walenty Gorski?" I ask.

"No. Who’s Gorski?"

I lean closer and give him my best "we’re on the same team" look.  "Tell you what: I’ll share what I know if you give me the name of the victim.  It’s going to be in the paper by tomorrow anyway."

After a bit more back-and-forth he tells me that the dead guy was Constantine Afanasyev, resident of East Village.  He was found face-down outside of Central Park, at the Engineer’s Gate entrance.  He had a large buck knife in his lower back, and was stabbed several times. Was probably dead within minutes.

They think he was killed late last night.  He didn’t have Gorski’s mail on him, just a wallet with a few bucks, some change, a driver’s license, and some weird notes that they couldn’t make sense of -- written in a foreign language, they think.  I ask to see the notes and he tells me I’d have a better chance getting a date with Lana Turner.

"We’re still waiting on an autopsy from the Chief Medical examiner, but it looks like this guy was dead within minutes of the attack -- didn’t even get a chance to run."

"Any idea what he was doing uptown?" I finally ask.

"You tell me," he says, forking in another square.

I head up to room 713 of the Cumberland.  That strange smell hits me again as I leave the elevator, but it’s gone -- or I get used to it -- by the time I reach the room.

Mrs. Browning opens the door as I’m in the middle of knocking.  She sees the box in my arms and takes it from me without speaking.

"You found it," she says.

"Well… not exactly," I demur.  She doesn’t really hear me.

She excitedly unwraps the book on the counter and moves her hands across it, seemingly relieved.

"This is your book?" I ask.

"I.. Think so.. " she says, opening it, the relief settling into her voice.  But then after a few more seconds: "Well… wait…"

She starts flipping through the pages. "No, no, this isn’t right!"

That’s not what I wanted to hear.

"What’s wrong, Mrs Browning?"

"It’s not my book.  It’s \textit{not} my book."

She shoves it roughly aside, disgusted.

"You’re quite sure?" I ask.

She looks at me for the first time with real anger.  "It’s not my god damned book.  What are you trying to do, Mr. Deverell?  Did you think I wouldn’t know my own book?  Did you think I would thank you and crawl away back home? Find my god damned book!"

I’m taken aback by her reaction, just as another wave of the strange smell hits me from the bedroom.  I try to snap out of it.  "I’ll keep looking," is all I can think to say, then, "Don’t worry. I’ll find your book."

That seems to break through, and I can see tears starting to well up in her eyes.  "I need that book back, Mr. Deverell.  It’s all I have left of my family."

"I’ll find it," I say, as I pick up the ‘wrong’ book and see myself out.

I decide to take the stairs to the 7th floor of the Cumberland, to give myself time to think about how much I should tell Mrs. Browning of what I’ve discovered -- or how hard to press her on some lingering questions.

As I near the landing, I think I hear her voice berating the hotel help.  But it’s quiet in the hallway, and when I make the long walk to room 713, I can see under the door that the lights are off.  I knock. No one answers.  I spend a few minutes standing there listening for activity, then give up and head back downstairs.

Wyckoff’s Rare books  is one of those New York bookstores that feels like it’s out of a movie.  It has a spooky feel, with antique light-bulbs and a maze of 10ft-high floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, all cramped into a footprint that can’t be more than 20ft by 20ft.

I find the proprietor, an old white-haired gentleman, limping down one of the rows with a large blackened tome in his hand and searching for a place to put it.  It looks heavy, but he doesn’t seem to be having any trouble carrying it.  He finally shelves it next to another large book -- this one red, with what looks like a child’s drawing of a skull on the cover.

"You must be Mr. Wyckoff," I say.

He looks me up and down as if sizing me up.  "And who are you?" he says.

"I’m Jack Deverell, Mr. Wyckoff.  I’ve been hired by a Mrs. Browning to help locate a lost book.  I’m told you met with her on Sunday to appraise it.  An old Bible."

"\textit{An old Bible!} \textbf{Ha!} Is that how she described it?  Heh… well, I guess it is an old Bible after all."

"What can you tell me about it?  Was it authentic?  How much was it worth?"

He gives me a long look which might be mistaken for disgust.  "How much was it worth?  Who are you? You’re not the client.  It’s not your book.  You don’t know anything about it."

"What about some jewelry of hers, some of ruby earrings, a necklace, and a bracelet? They’re missing from her hotel room -- any chance you walked off with them accidentally?"

"You can fuck right off out of my store."

"Whoa," I say.  "Take it easy there, we’re working for the same lady."

"I’m not working for anybody -- she hasn’t paid me yet.  She’ll burn before I see a cent."

"What does that mean?"

"Fuck off, you don’t know."

"Mr. Wyckoff, where were you this morning around 8am?"

"Fucking your wife, you vermin."

"I’m not married."

At this point he calms himself down, then licks his finger and draws a large round circle in the air in front of my face.  "Now you can \textit{really} fuck off."

I can see this is going nowhere, so I thank Wyckoff for his hospitality and then leave.

\hrulefill

Playing a hunch, I cross 3rd Avenue and enter a shop with a window facing Wyckoff’s Rare Books.  Wyckoff himself comes limping out of his bookstore and flips the sign on the door from Open to Closed, then heads south on 3rd Avenue.

He’s walking pretty fast for a guy with a limp, but it’s not like I’m going to lose him, so I take my time and let him get half a block away before lighting up a cigarette and starting to follow him.

He continues south where 3rd Avenue turns into the Bowery, then turns left on Houston, and then right on Chrystie.  For a minute I panic when I think he’s going to head into the train station on Delancey, and I close my distance.  But he keeps going until he hits the entry to the garden park, then hangs a left and goes down Grand Street.

Then, something stupid happens.  He gets almost to the corner of Allen Street, and as I’m reaching into my pocket to get another cigarette, the old guy suddenly turns around in a full circle and spots me looking right at him.

I’m caught off guard, and I hesitate before making a poor pretense at window shopping.  But I can see from the corner of my eye that he’s looking right at me.

Eventually he heads into a real estate office on Allen Street.  Five minutes later he’s headed back uptown the same way he came.

I convince myself that maybe he didn’t recognize me after all, and waste another 30 minutes following him back up to the bookstore, where he turns the sign from Closed to Open and doesn’t emerge again.

I happen to know one of the security guys who works at the India Consulate, a retired cop named Jeffrey Haykin.  I have to wait for nearly an hour for him to come downstairs, but that probably works in my favor as he feels bad for making me wait so long.

I describe my guy to him, give him my best guess at a name -- Choku or Chako, or something similar -- and tell him this guy is too violent to have avoided a criminal record.

Jeff heads back upstairs, and a half-hour later he’s back with a name.

"Choka Bahandari.  He’s a bad dude.  Served time in India for animal abuse and some kind of ritualistic killing, before some batshit crazy rich white lady bribed someone at the jail and the next thing you know he shows up in the US."

"Thanks, Jeff, I owe you one."

"Looks like I’m making progress but I’m not sure where to focus my efforts -- any ideas?"

"Well, for sure you should track down both of the dealers and figure out as much about them as you can -- or at least until you know who you are dealing with.  Then there’s the issue of the stolen jewelry.  It’s hard to know if it’s central to your case or not, but you should definitely chase down the details and try to put a bow on that -- at least figure out who’s involved even if hard proof and recovering the jewels is outside the scope of your work.  Maybe track down those packages as well -- might give you a few more clues about who’s behind this whole thing."

"What about these stabbings -- I’m sure they’re related to my case."

"Well then, track down the victims and see what you can learn about them.  Where did they live?  Where did they work?  Etc.  I always tell you to focus on the people, the rest will fall into place.  And have you got a theory about how the book was taken?  Seems to me you need to develop a theory for who could have taken it and how, even if their motives are unclear.  Remember, Jack, you cut your teeth in financial crimes; sometimes a motive is as simple as pay for hire, so It wouldn’t hurt to try to follow up that angle and knock on a few doors."

"I’m afraid I’m not going to be able to recover your book, Mrs. Browning.  It’s obvious that something shady is going on here, and I don’t want to end up an accessory in… whatever it is.  Jewel will help you settle up your account."

Mrs. Browning seems to freeze in place -- staring at me open-mouthed.  After a while she catches herself and opens up her purse to get out a cigarette.  She makes me wait while she takes her time retrieving a lighter and lighting it, then takes a deep breath.

"I don’t suppose I could convince you to change your mind? Perhaps if I doubled your fee?"

"I’m afraid not, Mrs. Browning.  It’s not really a matter of money… more a matter of dead bodies."

"Pfft…  Dead bodies…  The world is filled with dead bodies, Mr. Deverell."  She takes another drag.  "Once they’re dead, they don’t matter much, do they?"

"Umm… I’m not sure I follow."

Mrs. Browning waves off the idea with a hand gesture, and puts out her cigarette in the ashtray on my desk.  "You know where it is, though, don’t you? The book?"

"Yes, ma’am, I believe I do."

"And did you…  Well, have you looked inside it?"

"No, Mrs. Browning, I haven’t actually had the chance."

"Well then, I guess our business is concluded."  She brushes off her jacket.  "Of course I won’t be paying your bill -- that goes without saying."

"You did say it," pipes up Jewel from the corner.

"I will, however, be suing your office for breach of contract.  You can expect to get a letter from my solicitor in the morning."

"Of course," I say. "Jewel will show you out."

"I’ll show myself out," she says, and walks right past her.  I stand with Jewel at the door as we watch Mrs. Browning join a large gentleman in the back of a waiting cab.

"That fucking bitch," I say under my breath.

"Jack, language," says Jewel, not looking at me.

"Any thoughts on whether I might be missing anything important?" I ask.

"Just to make sure you’ve dotted all your i’s and crossed all of your t’s," he says, then reaches for a cigar on his desk as he continues:

"You’ve described tailing this Wyckoff guy from his bookstore.  It sure sounds like he spotted you right before he got to his final destination.  I hope you were able to figure out where he was likely going.

I’m not sure it would help in that case, since he was on foot, but you have remembered to talk to taxi companies in your neighborhoods of interest, yeah? Those can sometimes strike gold, especially when you’re dealing with rich people who may want to avoid public transportation.

And I know you like to have hard and fast proof for everything, Jack, but sometimes in a case like this the best you can do is circumstantial evidence that puts the right person at the right place at the right time -- so to speak.

Now about your murders: if you haven’t identified the culprit by name, well, it may mean there’s no way to do so…  On the other hand, it may be that you can, if you can locate people who interacted with him, and get enough pieces of identifying information out of them.

If you can get a good description from someone who saw him, it’s possible you can reach out to a governmental office that could put a name to a face.  Then maybe you can figure out how he connects to someone else in your case.

Now regarding the whereabouts of the book, let me see those notes you got."

I hand him the notes and he chews on his cigar, thinking.

"The one that stands out to me as being a little strange is this last one." He hands it back to me and continues, "Something about this one feels a bit odd.  Not like it’s a code or cipher, but more just oddly worded."

"All the notes sound odd to me," I say, "like this guy had a screw loose."

"Well, they’re definitely from a fanatic; I’m just not sure they’re from a murderer.  Whoever’s sending these seems to view you not as a threat or rival, but more as a confidant."

"Any thoughts on the stolen jewelry?" I ask.

"Well, assuming they’ve just stolen it to sell it, you may have a hard time putting eyes on it.  They’re likely to keep it under wraps until it’s safe to dispose of.  But you may be able to get a good idea who was involved just by talking to suspects and observing them closely -- looking and listening for ‘tells’ -- slip ups that suggest they know something more than they’re saying."

"Thanks," I say. "I appreciate the talk, chief."

"Anytime," he says.

The nice thing about the small startup delivery services is that they haven’t bought into the paranoia about privacy.  Ask nicely and with a bit of authority, and more often than not, they will tell you everything they know.

Unfortunately in this case it’s not much.  The package was a walk-in, and they paid with cash.  No return address given.  The guy behind the counter does remember the fancy calligraphy on the plain brown box, though, and remembers what the guy who brought it in looked like:

"Short, balding, wire-rim glasses.  Left heading south.  Is that helpful?"

"Very helpful," I say.

I take a number and a seat.  30 minutes later I hear my number called, and finally I’m under window 15 talking to a heavily-perfumed middle-aged woman.   I make the mistake of telling her that I’m a PI looking for information on Constantine Afanasyev.  Sometimes I forget I’m no longer a cop.

Mrs. Iyona recalls the old guy with white hair who came into her real estate office earlier:

"Well.. He looked around a bit, confused, then asked me what kind of real estate I handle.  I told him that I handle all kinds and asked him if he was looking to buy, sell, or rent.  He said he’d rather sell his store to the devil than sell it to me.  That’s a strange thing to say, don’t you think?"

"I do."

"Are \textit{you} interested in purchasing some real estate?" she asks.

"I wouldn’t mind a vacation home in Florida," I say.

"I’m afraid I can’t help you with that" she says, and I head out.

The door to apartment 3c is small and cheap, hollow core and painted white.  I guess it’s a bad habit that my mind is always figuring how hard it would be to break down a door.  A small handwritten card taped to the door says "\textbf{Gorski, Walenty}".

I knock a few times and listen, but there’s no sign of any activity.

There’s a mail slot near the bottom of the door, so after I look around and see the hallway is clear, I go down on the balls of my feet and push open the slot and look in.  Place looks pretty empty.  A chair sitting in the hallway and an empty table.  Nothing on the walls.  Pretty suspicious when you think about it.  I stand in front of the door for a minute considering my options… Can’t really bust down the door on a hunch.  I wonder if maybe a neighbor or doorman would know anything about the occupant.

The Cumberland Hotel is an elegant-looking square 12-story building on the corner of Broadway and 54th Street.  I ask the front desk if I can speak to someone who was on duty this morning, and get directed to a middle-aged woman who’s checking in an elderly couple.

When she finally hands them off to a bellhop, I ask her if she remembers Mrs. Browning.  She does, and confirms she checked in on Saturday afternoon.

"And can you tell me if she checked in alone?"  The woman consults a book briefly, and confirms that Mrs. Browning checked in alone on Saturday.

"Did you see her this morning?" I ask.

"I haven’t seen her today, but I wasn’t on duty early this morning.  The staff member that was will be here all day tomorrow, you could ask him then.  But I do remember she had several visitors yesterday afternoon.  A short, balding gentleman, and an older, taller gentleman."

"One last question.  I’m sure you’re aware that Mrs. Browning had an expensive item stolen from her hotel room while she was out getting breakfast.  Have you talked to the maids on duty?  Is there any chance one of them lifted it and is too scared to admit it?"

"I don’t see how," she says. "The maids hadn’t even come in when she reported her items missing, and someone would have noticed if one of them had come in early."

"Anyone else who would have a key to the room?"

"Only the clerk on duty at the time -- and me of course, but I certainly didn’t enter her room."

"Thank you for your help.  By the way, how’s the restaurant here?"

"Best in the city." she says mechanically, with zero enthusiasm.

I make a U-turn, head back into the DMV and take a number.  Another 30 minutes later and I’m at window 7, in front of a cute blond in curls who’s chewing bubble-gum.

"Hello," I say, in my best Russian accent, taking off my hat.  "My name Constantine Afanasyev."  I have a hard time with the last name, but Bubble-Gum doesn’t seem to think that’s strange.  I push over the document I found at Constantine’s apartment.  "I would like to pay fee."

Bubble-Gum girl looks over the letter, then at me, then back at the letter, then responds as if talking to a small child.

"It looks like your car has been impounded for failure to pay your tickets."

"I will pay," I say. "Where was car?"

"One moment, wait here, please."  She heads back into the open-air labyrinth behind her, and returns with a piece of paper.

"These are your most recent tickets," she says, handing me a machine printout.  "Everything from this year before the car was impounded.  We don’t have details for the previous years.  You owe \$130.32.  You can pay now by check or cash."

"I will come back," I say, pocketing the printout.

The famous Carnegie Jewish Delicatessen, known for its giant sandwiches, is hopping.  I know the owner, Milton, and I shoulder my way through to him.

"How’s the pastrami, Milton?"

"Wait here," he says, and disappears behind the counter to bring up a slice from some private reserve.  "This is the good stuff," he says. "You want I should make you a sandwich?"

"Actually, I’m hoping for some information."

"Oh?" he says, putting down the pastrami absentmindedly.

"Can you remember a woman who may have come in Monday morning around 8am? She’d have been alone, dressed nicely in a black outfit."

"Turkey on whitebread, and Roast Beef on thick-cut rye."

"\textit{Two} sandwiches, you sure about that?"

"Two sandwiches. She ate the one small one at a table over there, and took the other with her to go.  And there’s something else."

"Oh yeah?"

"Yeah. I think there was someone watching her.  Older guy with white hair. He was watching her through the window, and I even went outside to ask him if there was something I could help him with.  He wasn’t mean or anything, he had a big smile, and he just said "no" and crossed the street.  But then he kept watching the building until she left."

"Thanks, Milton, you’re the best."

"What about that pastrami, you want me to slice you half a pound?"

"Not today, Milton. I’ve got places to go."

I reach out to a contact I have at an auction house up town, who I know won’t ask questions.  The book never comes up for auction, of course, but my contact sells it to a local collector for a thousand bucks -- or at least that’s what he tells me it sold for.  We split the proceeds and I end up with 500 dollars.  That’s a hell of a lot less than it would have gotten at a public auction, but then there’d be too many questions asked.  I can’t help but wonder if I made the right decision.

\label{sec:7{-}0179}\textbf{Inside the Convent of the Sacred Heart}%


I think about heading to a callbox and calling it in, but my hand is on automatic and I’m testing the door knob before I know it.  To my surprise, it turns easily and I gently open the door.

"Hello?" I say, half-heartedly.

Inside the side entrance to the Convent of the Sacred Heart is a scene of chaos.  The room looks like some combination of a scullery, a kitchen, and a study area.  There are sinks, pantry supplies, and large tables and benches.

But the whole place has been trashed.  The doors of the cabinets that fill the walls are all flung open, their contents lying on the floor in heaps. Boxes of papers and supplies have been dumped everywhere.  Either some hooligans were in here trying to wreck the place, or someone was in here looking for something they couldn’t find.  I’m betting on the latter.  I notice some yellowed letterhead with the school watermark on it: "CSH".

I walk around downstairs and it’s more of the same -- every drawer and cabinet flung open and their contents dumped on the ground.

Eventually I come to a little office whose light is still on, and whose door appears to have been kicked in.  Its hinges just barely cling on to a door frame that’s been dislodged.

"Hello? Is anyone there? My name is Jack Deverell, I’m a Private Investigator.  I’m armed." And with that I kneel down and retrieve the Smith \& Wesson revolver in my ankle holster.  It’s my backup gun, but lately I’ve been walking around without my main sidearm.

I push on the office door and it slowly swings open.  Then I’m hit with that familiar exotic smell.

On the small desk, face up and lying lengthwise, is who I’m betting is the man known to Mrs. Browning as Walenty Gorski.  Not that she’d recognize his face anymore.  It’s all mashed up and bloody, like a raw steak.  But he’s short and balding, and he’s got a round head.  I look around for his wire-rim glasses and finally locate them on the floor, a mangled mess.

His shirt is torn and I can see the odd angles of broken ribs under the skin.  His mouth and eyes are open, and there’s a large pool of congealing blood under his head.

I go to check his pockets, but then notice they’re all ripped open.  Guess someone beat me to it.  The desk drawers are all tossed like the others.

I spend a few more minutes surveying the scene to ensure I’m not overlooking anything, making sure there’s no hidden cubby holes or lock boxes, and then finally retrace my steps out of the building -- wiping down the door frames so I don’t accidentally get myself mixed up in a murder investigation.

When I was a hotshot NYPD detective I’d have just waltzed into 255 Greenwich Street and headed downstairs to meet with Tomas Gonzales, the chief medical examiner for New York City, to look at the body and hear a preliminary autopsy report from the man himself.  As a PI, though, the best I can do is try to sweet talk the gal at the front desk -- Mary, who knows me from my days on the force.

"How are you doing, Mary? Long time no see."

"Jack, it’s good to see you landed on your feet.  That wasn’t right what happened to you."

"Water under the bridge," I say.  Not quite true, but maybe if I say it enough I’ll believe it myself one day.  "Mary, can you give me something on that murder in Central Park? I’m working a case that the victim was involved in."

She looks around a little before drawing me closer.  "I don’t know much, they’re still working it.  But, I know the guy was stabbed a bunch of times in the back.  Lots of blood, they think he died quickly.  But also, it seems like the killer did something weird.  Carved some kind of symbol in his back after he killed him.  That’s all I know."

The building at 332 E. 11th Street is just one of many row houses here, stretching nearly the entire block, all painted a peeling white.  There’s a round buzzer mounted on a square of wood to the right of the door; a label below it bears the name "Afanasyev", with two small hand-drawn crucifixes on either side.  I ring the doorbell but get no answer.

I think long and hard about breaking the door in, but it looks solid.

I call out towards the steps -- "Help!  I need some help down here!  A man’s been injured."  Then I take off my tie and give it to the man, motioning that he should put it around his neck -- but he’s in shock, he’s not hearing anything I’m saying.  I hear footsteps coming down the stairs, and decide I’m not much more good to him now.

I jump the turnstile and rush through into the doors of the uptown IRT just as they’re closing.  The train pulls out of the station, and I can hear some faint screaming from the platform.

I sit down and try to calm my breathing and regain my wits.  What just happened?  I don’t think I was spotted by my guy, but even if I was, why would he have attacked this attendant?  Was this just a coincidence?

I look around for my guy in the tan suit.  Everyone looks suspicious and malevolent, and I’m having trouble concentrating.  Eventually I do spot him, calm as can be, reading a paperback at the end of the car without a care in the world.

By the time we get to Lenox HIll, my breathing has slowed down.  At 86th Street my guy gets up and heads to the door.  I look for signs he knows he’s being followed, but he seems oblivious.  If this is the guy who cut the throat of the subway attendant, his veins are filled with ice water.

I head to the same door, determined not to lose him again -- but there’s a small crowd of people between us, and as the doors open he’s first to exit, while the lady in front of me struggles with her shopping cart.

By the time I get out of the door I’ve lost sight of him, but I pick up my pace towards the exit as the train pulls away, and it won’t be hard to spot him once we get up to street level.

There’s nowhere for him to go but up.

Then suddenly I’m slammed hard from the left. Feels like I walked in front of a train, and for a minute that’s where my brain goes.  But then I’m over the edge of the platform and onto the train tracks, my ankle twisting as I fall.  I hit my head hard on one of the rails.

My vision swims, and for a second that strange, exotic smell fills my nostrils. I feel myself black out for a moment. Seconds later I come to with blood pounding a drumbeat in my head, struggling to stand up, stumbling to pick up my hat which lies a few feet away.

A small crowd has gathered on the platform, yelling to me, and a muscled young man is reaching down to help me up off the tracks.

I drag myself painfully onto the platform, my head still throbbing. I touch it gingerly and wet blood smears my fingers. The ankle’s sore as well, but it doesn’t seem to be broken and it still holds me -- just – as I hobble towards the exit. Should probably go to a doctor to get both of them checked out, but I don’t have the time or the money.

\%solo.TurnPage\%

I press a handkerchief to the cut until it stops bleeding, then brush off my pants and do my best to get my bearings. Back on the street I suck in the clear air gratefully, but there’s no sign of my guy.

Ulrich Wannemaker, the proprietor of Wannemaker and Son, stares in awe when I show him the book.

"My God," he says, turning the pages almost reverently.  "It’s magnificent."

"It’s \textit{real}?" I ask, unable to hide my surprise.

"It’s an Octavo King James Bible.  The best one I’ve ever seen."

"And it’s authentic? Nothing strange about it?"

He takes my question seriously, and studies it carefully for several minutes before pronouncing his verdict.  "No doubt about its authenticity.  And I don’t see anything unusual about it other than its pristine condition.  It’s been extremely well cared for,  The hand-colored plates are exquisite.  I don’t think a finer copy has ever been found.  Where on earth did you get it?"

"It’s a long story," I say.  "Could you estimate its value?"

"I really couldn’t say.  I’ve never heard of one in this condition coming up for auction."

"A ballpark figure?"

"Well…  Maybe \$5,000?"

I take off my hat and whistle.  He closes the book, and we both stare at it for a long while.

The storefront window in front of 262 Sixth avenue holds displaycase after displaycase of round marbles in all colors, each one with a dark spot in the center -- a bit like eyes.  Takes me a moment to process what I’m looking at, then I see the sign that says "ARTIFICIAL HUMAN EYES".

A handwritten card on the inside of the window says "Try our new antacid, it’s good for your eyes!’

I head in and purchase a tiny bottle for a nickel from the guy behind the counter.  It doesn’t have a label; it’s just a clear glass bottle with a stopper.   It tastes like chalk.  I try to keep my face from frowning, but it doesn’t work.

"What’s the deal with the antacid?" I ask.

"Not much demand for artificial eyes," he says.

"How’s the demand for antacid?" I ask.

"Eh." he says, shrugging his shoulders.

I take another swig and leave the empty bottle on the counter as I head out.

I almost walk right past the stairs down to the IRT station at Lexington and 51st, but I can see it’s where my guy must have gone.  Damn it.  He’s got a couple of minutes on me now, and I can hear a train in the station.  If I’m lucky the train is pulling in. If I’m unlucky…  Well, I guess there’s next week.

I hurry down the steps into the subway, and I can see the uptown train is just pulling into the station.  Lucky.  If I hurry I can just make it.

I reach into my pocket for a dime and look around for the attendant.  I don’t see him.  I’m just thinking about jumping the turnstile when I catch something out of the corner of my eye.

Off to the side of the station, there’s a guy sitting on the ground with his hands around his throat.  The first thing that comes to my mind is that it’s my guy, but it’s not -- it’s the attendant.  And there’s blood leaking out between his fingers and quietly pooling onto his pants.

I look at the man, then back over my shoulder where I can see the train just coming to a stop.

Probably it’s the connection to our case, but I find myself genuinely curious about the exhibit of controversial religious books.  Jewel and I hop the train to 79th Street on the Upper West Side.

The midnight gala event at the museum is a pretty ritzy affair.  I’m not sure how Jewel managed to get us tickets at the last minute, but she’s resourceful like that.  As we’re walking up the steps we see mayor Fiorello La Guardia, already inside shaking hands with someone, his pudgy face and rotund body exuding unmistakeable charm.


\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth, height=6in,keepaspectratio]{E:/MyDocs/Programming/Python/hlweb2/hldjango/media/games/1_8cc64ae6-1d77-11ef-935f-24418c05e14f/uploadsStory/MuseumNaturalHistory2.jpg}\end{center}


The Museum of Natural History is one of my favorite places.  It’s an awe-inspiring place. Dozens of dimly-lit rooms, with giant life-sized dioramas of cavemen and dinosaurs, pottery and tablets from the beginning of civilization, and sparkling gemstones the size of your head.

Jewel seems just as interested as I am, and we leisurely walk to the religious book exhibit, separated by only a few feet of space but a million years of daydreaming.

The controversial book exhibit itself is mildly interesting.  I’m half-expecting to see a copy of Mrs. Browning’s book on display, but no dice.  There’s a big section discussing religious books from different cultures, and how each one was treated as blasphemous and sacrilegious by others, despite their common themes.  And there’s a section of shockingly vibrant paintings of Hindu gods that defy description.  I make a note to myself to dig out my oil paints when I get home.

There is a section on controversial Christian Bibles, but they seem to be mostly about misprinted editions. The "Wicked" Bible, otherwise known as the "Sinner’s Bible", was published in 1631 in London, where they accidentally left out the word "not" from the sentence "Thou shalt not commit adultery."  Ouch.  Most copies were destroyed, making it highly valuable.  But there’s no hint of any controversy related to Mrs. Browning’s book.

"Pretty fascinating stuff, huh, Jewel?"

Jewel doesn’t hear me; she’s lost in thought.  We wander around a bit more in silence, then part ways and head to our respective homes.

I sweet-talk the receptionist at the check-in desk into letting me go up to the room of Mr. Kornacki, the subway attendant who was attacked on Tuesday, by telling her I’m a friend of the victim.  Eh. it’s not too far off from the truth.

In his hospital room, Mr. Kornacki looks much improved from when I last saw him, and he grasps my hand weakly when he recognizes me.  He seems to think I saved his life.  I don’t tell him he’s wrong.

I have to lean in close to hear his short, whispered words, but he does his best to tell me what he remembers.

He was attacked by a large, swarthy man -- at least 6ft tall.  He doesn’t remember what he was wearing, but definitely not a full suit.  The man had tried to rush past him through the turnstile to the platform without paying, and the attendant had blocked his path.  The fee went up to a dime last year, he added, and some people were very unhappy about it.  Somehow I doubt that was the issue.  Then, before Kornacki knew what had happened, he saw a flash of a blade and felt his shirt covered in blood.

I ask him if he recalls any strange smell, but he can’t remember.  The man ran past him and onto the uptown platform.  "It’s only a dime…" he finally says, shaking his head.

Fearing I’ll change my mind if I sleep on it, I pick up the book and head out to the local precinct.  Thirty minutes later, it’s done, and I’m walking home empty-handed. Jewel greets me at the door with the bottle of whiskey from the bookshelf, and two glasses.  "Don’t think about it," she says.

"It hurts," I say.

I take a seat at the Cumberland Hotel bar and order a whiskey, neat.  Nothing fancy about the bar, but it does offer me a discreet view of the lobby from where I’m seated.

There’s a girl to my left who looks like she might have been a dancer in another life.  She’s too tan to be a New York native, so I ask her what she’s doing in the city.  She tells me she’s traveling with her husband, and just like that, a man I recognize pulls up alongside her.

"Come on, Jenny, we’ll be late," he says.

"OK, Bill, I’m coming," she says.

It’s Bud Abbott.  He looks shorter in real life.  I look around for Lou but he’s nowhere to be seen.  I try to hear what they’re saying as they move off, but all I pick up is something about Coney Island.

The rest of the evening is uneventful, and at around 12:45 am I call it a night and pay my tab.  As I’m heading out, I almost get knocked over by someone hurrying the other way -- big hulking guy with light-brown skin and a big bushy beard.

Dear Detective,

You may not yet understand, but you will.  My calling is righteous and only GOD can judge my trespasses and deceptions.  The book you seek is evil, but it is safe now, protected by the angels. You must stop searching for it.  Wicked are the words, and wicked is the witch who wields it.  She must not be allowed to regain it.  It is safe now.  Even if she and her devils find me and put me to the rack, it is safe now.  And if I should fall, you must deliver it, not to the witch but to my master.  He will know what to do.

When I get into the office, Jewel is sitting cross-legged on her desk eating Chinese take-out food, cold sesame noodles and dumplings.

"Jack, I think it’s time to wrap this case up.  Mrs. Browning just called and she’s furious that you haven’t found the book yet.  She said she’s coming in bright and early tomorrow morning and you better have something for her.  You know what you’re going to tell her?"

I pick up a dumpling with my chopsticks and dip it into the soy sauce, enjoying the salty ocean taste.  "I’m not sure…"

Mrs. Browning turns up at the office Thursday morning, demanding a progress report on her case.  Jewel shows her in and lingers by the door to hear what I’ll say.

"Where is my book, Mr. Deverell? Have you located it yet? What’s taking so long?" she says, speaking the way only women born into privilege or good looks can.

"It’s a little complicated," I say, taking a deep breath and standing up.

\label{sec:NEWYORKTIMES{-}Monday,March9th,1948}
District Attorney Frank S. Hogan has today announced the arrest of Choka Bahandari, an Indian national, for last week’s violent murder of Constantine Afanasyev, and the arrest of Mrs. Clarice Browning of Salem, Massachusetts as an accessory after the fact.  The charging documents describe how Mr. Bahandari attacked Mr. Afanasyev outside of Central Park after following him from his place of work, the Convent of the Sacred Heart.  Early reporting suggests that Mr. Bahandari was operating at the behest of Mrs. Browning, whose background and occupation remain unconfirmed.

\label{sec:NEWYORKTIMES{-}Wednesday,March12th,1948}
New developments emerged today in the case of last week’s Central Park stabbing of Constantine Afanasyev.   Rumors continue to circulate about the two suspects who have been charged with the murder, Mr. Choka Bahandari and Mrs. Clarice Browning.  Reliable sources have told the Times that the two are well known in Salem, and are rumored to be members of an underground religious organization long banned in the state of Massachusetts.  Mrs. Browning’s family allegedly has long-standing ties to occult and satanic churches in the state, dating back several generations.

A date has been set in the murder trial of Clarice Browning and Choka Bahandari, who stand accused of the ritualistic stabbing murder of a worker from the Convent of the Sacred Heart.  The suspects had not released any statement to the press at the time of going to print.  The trial is set to begin on May 3rd.  In a shocking twist, the district attorney has revealed that the two are being charged with an additional murder.

It’s been a month since the case of the Missing Book, and I’ve been sitting here for the last 30 minutes, staring at the pristine edition of the Octavo King James Bible sent over by the folks who stole Mrs. Browning’s copy.  It’s worth thousands and I still haven’t decided what to do with it. I buzz Jewel, and the two of us spend a few more minutes staring at it together.  She’s like the Sphinx, that one; she doesn’t let on what she’s thinking.

\section*{NEW YORK TIMES - Monday, May 3rd, 1948}%

\label{sec:NEWYORKTIMES{-}Monday,May3rd,1948}
Opening statements were delivered today in the murder trial of Clarice Browning, the leader of a banned occult church from Salem, Massachusetts, and her accomplice Choka Bahandari.  District Attorney Frank Hogan laid out the facts of the case:  In early March of this year, Mrs. Browning arrived in the Cumberland Hotel in Manhattan, carrying with her an occult book she intended to have appraised and then sold.  To a shocked courtroom, he described the book as a rare and sacrilegious text: a corrupted variant of the Octavo King James Bible, produced in 1600 by an underground group of dissident monks, with a dozen or more additional hand-illustrated pages of pornographic, satanic, and occult imagery. The one-of-a-kind Bible was purchased by Mrs. Browning’s ancestor, and had only ever been rumored among occultists to exist.

Mr. Hogan described the chain of events as follows: Mrs. Browning used her contacts in the occult underworld to locate two potential dealers for an appraisal of the Bible.  One of these, a Mr. Wyckoff, allegedly robbed Mrs. Browning of valuable jewelry while briefly left alone with the book in her hotel room.  The jewelry was recovered from the pawnshop of a Mr. Cremonesi, who has since pleaded guilty to receipt of stolen goods.
\begin{displayquote}

\textit{As I read this I think back over my interactions with Wyckoff and Cremonesi, how the two of them used some of the same odd vernacular, and how Cremonesi had slipped up when denying he had seen the stolen jewelry.  Not to mention how Wyckoff had been steps away from the pawn shop before he spotted me and turned back.}
\end{displayquote}

The other dealer, going by the name Walenty Gorski, was in truth an agent for an underground Catholic organization whose stated purpose is to remove sacrilegious texts from distribution.  It appears this organization, operating locally out of the Convent of the Sacred Heart, had become aware of the book’s existence and sought to steal it.

The organization used the Phoenix Safe Company, owned by a sympathetically aligned religious family, to burgle the hotel room of Mrs. Browning and steal the book.  Father and son, both trained locksmiths, allegedly worked together -- one monitoring the whereabouts of Mrs. Browning while she left her hotel room for breakfast, and the other picking the lock of her hotel room door in order to obtain the book.  Witnesses at the Cumberland Hotel and the Carnegie Deli were able to positively identify both men.  It is unclear whether the ultimate aim was to acquire the book in order to dispose of it, or simply to remove it from circulation.

When Mrs. Browning discovered that the book had been stolen, she hired a private investigator to track it down, but directed her accomplice Mr. Bahandari (who had secretly checked into a separate room of the hotel) to conduct a parallel investigation, and to recover the book by any means necessary.

\section*{NEW YORK TIMES - Tuesday, May 4th, 1948}%

\label{sec:NEWYORKTIMES{-}Tuesday,May4th,1948}
The prosecution today continued their case against Clarice Browning and Choka Bahandari,  describing how Mr. Bahandari had managed to locate an employee of the  Sacred Heart Convent, Constantine Afanasyev.  Mr. Afanasyev had been hired to pick up mail from the Gorski residence, which was used by the organization as a kind of front from which they could safely conduct their clandestine operations.  Afanasyev was apparently followed to the Convent of the Sacred Heart, and murdered nearby.

In a shocking disclosure, the district attorney described a second, previously unreported murder of another Sacred Heart employee, believed to be the book appraiser known to Mrs. Browning as Walenty Gorski.  This man appears to have been tortured in an attempt to force him to reveal the location of the stolen book.

The prosecution has not yet identified the dead man, but they have confirmed that the real Gorski died several years ago.  It now appears that the Sacred Heart offices, along with the apartment where Gorski’s mail was delivered, were being used as a front for their clandestine operation; fake identities were also used to protect their members.  The motive behind these actions remains unclear, as does the method by which they made contact with Mrs. Browning.  District Attorney Frank Hogan has hinted that charges may be forthcoming at a further date.

There seems to be no dispute that the satanic book had been hidden all along in a floor safe at the Phoenix Safe Company; however, a warrant executed last month failed to recover the book, and its current whereabouts are unknown.
\begin{displayquote}

\textit{I realize as I read this paragraph in the paper that the mysterious note we received on wednesday mentions the word "safe" an inordinate number of times…  I guess the guy was hoping I would protect the book if anything happened to him. Either that or the guy had a screw loose and didn’t even realize what he was saying.}
\end{displayquote}

Police believe that the Sacred Heart is part of a larger organization, possibly run by the reclusive and politically-connected Reverend Carlo Lori, who appears to be the registered owner of many of the group’s real estate properties.  Police have declined to elaborate or discuss whether an active investigation is ongoing.

It was revealed in court today that this religious organization sent Mrs. Browning a genuine and highly valuable \textit{unadulterated} copy of the Bible in exchange for the stolen book, in an effort to dissuade her from trying to recover the stolen edition.  The whereabouts of the replacement book are currently unknown.

The private detective originally hired to locate the stolen book was none other than Jack Deverell, whose storied and controversial career in the NYPD has been the subject of many articles in the Times. Mr. Deverell could not be reached for comment, but a statement released from his office today said simply that he would not discuss any details of the case due to client confidentiality and the general lack of integrity on the part of the New York press core.

A shocking end today to the double-murder trial of Clarice Browning and Choka Bahandari.  Both were expected to take the stand today in their own defense, but were found deceased in their separate jail cells, apparently of self-inflicted cyanide poisoning.  As of yet there is no word on how the two could have obtained access to the poison.  Investigations are ongoing.

\label{sec:BehindtheScenes}\textbf{Postscript from the Author}%


I hope you have enjoyed this case.  I tried to make this one a little tricky with a variety of obstacles that you would have to figure out to follow up on leads.

One of the elements of the case that was most tricky was the way you were supposed to figure out that Wyckoff stole the jewelry.  Here is what I tried to do:

When you tail Wyckoff from his shop, he spots you at the end.  He made it to just right across the street from a pawn shop, which is meant to connect him to it.  The especially tricky part, however, is that he is right at the boundary of neighborhoods, and the pawn shop is in the next neighborhood over (Lower East Side).

You may in fact discover that pawn shop, as one player did, while investigating the dead body of Constantine, which may lead you to wrongly think he was the one who stole the jewelry.

There are, however, two more clues to connect Wyckoff to the pawn shop.  First, Wyckoff and Cremonesi, the pawn shop owner, have a similar disposition, and both use the words "vermin" -- I suspect they are good friends.  More damning, however, is that when we question the pawn shop owner, we mention "a stolen bracelet", when in fact it was several items that were stolen. He says "I haven’t seen \textbf{them}."  A little slip-up on his part that tells you he’s our man.

As a side note, early playtesters suffered trying to find the pawnshop because I accidentally put two more pawn shops on the same block as where Wyckoff turned around, and in the neighborhood where he was walking. Ouch.

Another subtle element is in the third note you get.  If you study it you will note that the word "safe" is used many times -- that’s meant to clue you in that he’s stashed it at the Phoenix Safe Company in the floor safe that is mentioned.  The old man and the kid with long brown hair that work there are the same people who were watching and breaking into Mrs. Browning’s hotel room on day 2.  The old man follows her to Carnegie Deli while the kid gets into her hotel room.  You’ll note that the PSC log on the Sacred Heart Convent is from their locksmith shop.

I had some spirited debates with playtesters about whether the clues to Phoenix Safe company were strong enough or too subtle.  In response I made some later changes to make it both a little bit easier to connect the Deli witness to the Phoenix guy, but also added a question that asked the players how they would prove it if they had to -- my hope is that that question will spur some debate (the answer is that you could try to get the deli and hotel people to id the phoenix father and son).

One more subtle element is tracking down the name of the killer, who works for Mrs. Browning.  To do so you’ll have to visit the taxi company serving the neighborhood where the murder took place.  The taxi company gives you the name of the driver and tells you to come back tomorrow when she gets in… but your case doesn’t last 4 days, so you’ll have to visit her yourself.  She’ll tell you his nationality and his first name.  With that you could go to the Indian Consulate and find out his full name.  And with that you can revisit the hotel to get his room number.  Note that this was meant to be a non-essential part of the mystery that only advanced players would be able to find.  I have to admit that a trip to the Indian Consulate is not the first thing that I would have thought to do.  So many consulates, so little time.

The last bit of bonus mystery for advanced players relates to the real identity of the man known as Gorski and the larger organization behind him.  If you visit the Property \& tax records office (6-5810): NYC Department of Finance (see Research Guide), you will learn the name of Reverend Carlo Lori, whom you can visit to confirm that he is the man behind the operation (and the man pretending to be Gorski).

I should note that there is a fair amount of disagreement on the part of early playtesters regarding the difficulty of the case and whether there is sufficient evidence for players to answer the questions about who took the book.  To me it feels like it’s a hard case but that there are enough clues to make an educated guess.  What do you think?

I hope you enjoyed the moral and other choices you faced.  Which choices did you make, and why?  There are no right or wrong answers.  You might be wondering about the instructions to record things in your "Campaign Log".  This case occurs somewhere in the middle of a long campaign planned for High \& Low, with legacy elements where your decisions in one case may carry over to another.  Whether that campaign gets finished remains to be seen.

One of the mechanical aspects of the case that underwent lots of debate was the use of the markers to "gate" your progress between days, to make sure you had seen certain things each day.  The basic idea of doing this has always been a key part to High \& Low, to help make the multi-day structure work.  Essentially this process ensures that players have seen critical leads so they have a reasonable chance of solving the case at the end, and that they don’t miss a critical lead that will make the experience unpleasant.  This was originally implemented in this case by having the player answer end-of-day questions that asked about certain things and sent them back into the field if they hadn’t found them.  Afterwards I had the idea of using the conditional markers (e.g. "mark letter A"), which are already used to check certain conditions, as checks between days.  This works mechanically, and we added a kind of time deadline to add some tension and reward efficient players -- though I hope it will not serve to discourage players from investigating everything.  An in-game hint system was added to help players that feel stuck and don’t know what to do.

I’d love to hear what you thought of the case and any bugs you found. You can contact me at jessereichler@gmail.com or stop by the Co-op For Two YouTube Channel or Discord server (link on YouTube "About" page).

If you’re interested in making your own case for the High \& Low system, stop by boardgamegeek.com and reach out to me -- the materials are all available and I’d love to see more cases made.

Special thanks to Debbie Levy for editing, and to early beta testers Dispaminite, Rocky Helton (who made his own case!), Jonathan Warner, Nicola Salmoria, and all the others in the High \& Low Discord roundtable for talking through ideas.

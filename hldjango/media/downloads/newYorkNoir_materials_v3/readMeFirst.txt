READ ME for New York Noir Documents (v2)
------------------------------------------

These files are needed to play New York Noir cases.

The rulesAndGuides/ folder contains instructions, guide books, etc.
The directoriesAndMaps/ folder contains game directories and maps.
The extras/ folder contains auxilliary downlods (essays, etc.)
 
----

IMPORTANT: You should *NOT* try to print out any of the directory
 files -- they are far too big and are likely to change in the near future.
 
----

The one document you should print out is "CaseLogClocked.pdf" for recording
 your progress during play.

----

You will also need to download the case book for the case you want to play.
 Casebooks come in multiple formats depending on whether you plan to play
 on a tablet (one lead per page), or print them out (compact 2-column format).

One advantage of printing out the casebook is being able to mark it up
 the document with your notes as you play.

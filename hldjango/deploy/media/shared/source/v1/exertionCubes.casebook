**Exertion Cubes**
Typically, you begin the game with **1 "Exertion Cube"**, and gain a single additional cube at the start of each new day (you can track the # of cubes you have with pen and paper if you prefer).
During the course of the game, you may occasionally face choices which benefit from having Exertion Cubes to spend (typically in the late night hours between days). If you end the game with surplus Exertion Cubes, they will add to your final score.
